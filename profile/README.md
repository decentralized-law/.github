# Decentralized Law

## Overview

Welcome to the Decentralized Law GitHub organization! This organization hosts a collection of legal frameworks and concepts designed to bridge blockchain technology with legal systems. Our mission is to create open, accessible legal infrastructure that supports the development of decentralized technologies while preserving individual liberty and consent-based governance.

## Foundation

This work is based on the comprehensive book "Decentralized Law: The Future of Law is Decentralized" by W. Thysse. The book explores 2,500 years of legal history and examines how blockchain technology can transform legal systems by prioritizing liberty and consent over centralized authority.

The book provides a thorough analysis of property rights associated with crypto assets, revealing how blockchain technology enables a form of digital ownership that is more direct and potentially more secure than traditional financial instruments. It examines the legality of popular blockchain applications such as smart contracts, tokenization, NFTs, DeFi, and DAOs, highlighting their missing legal frameworks and the challenges they face under current regulatory systems. To protect financial liberty, he introduced the legal instruments found below. The remainder of the book introduces the legal frameworks required to merge blockchain technology to existing legal frameworks.

Thysse's work presents exciting possibilities for a decentralized legal future, introducing revolutionary concepts like Smart Contract Blocks, Consensus Jurisdictions, and Decentralized Legal Systems. The book demonstrates how blockchain technology can empower global legal cooperation, enable bottom-up law-making, and create more balanced, liberty-preserving frameworks. These innovations open the door to peer-to-peer finance, cross-border voluntary cooperation, and a new form of globalization based on consent rather than authorityâ€”ultimately transforming how we create and interact with laws in the digital age!

## Repositories

This organization maintains the following key repositories:

### Decentralized Bill of Liberties

A foundational legal document that establishes universal human liberties that transcend jurisdictional boundaries. This bill outlines fundamental negative rights that apply equally to all individuals without requiring institutional involvement.

### Declaration of State Rights and Duties

A declaration establishing the rights and duties of sovereign states in the international order, designed to protect state sovereignty and set clear boundaries around international governance and overambitious international regulators.

### Freedom of the Nodes

A legal principle establishing that decentralized networks meeting specific criteria (containing native assets, governed by open-source code, sufficiently decentralized, and universally accessible) may be freely used without conditions by all humans.

### The Decentralized Autonomous Association (DAA)

A framework for associations that use blockchain technology to collaborate on creating and voting for binding standards and shared principles without engaging in risk bearing activities. DAAs do not face the legal problems DAOs run into, ensuring that these beneficial technologies become more widely used.
